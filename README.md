# FElupe Web
This Repository provides **FElupe** - *Finite Element Analysis* in your Browser. Due to limitations using JupyterLite / Pyodide, some features are not available. This esentially affects all parallel / threaded execution modes as well as all methods, functions, etc. that rely on the `numba` and `sparse` packages (e.g. Multi-Point-Constraints).
